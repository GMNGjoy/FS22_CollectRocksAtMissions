# Collect Rocks At Missions
My first denied mod on ModHub - built from the same code structure as the FS22_CollectStrawAtMissions mod, this mod allows you to collect rocks during Sowing or Cultivating contracts if you have stones turned on - which allows you to permanently get rocks off of NPC fields! It turns out the original author _derSchreiner_ used to work at GIANTS, so they felt that my mod was copyright infringement. I don't agree.

- The original mod for FS22_CollectStrawAtMissions is on ModHub. (https://www.farming-simulator.com/mod.php?lang=en&country=us&mod_id=223930&title=fs2022)

## Description from the ModDesc
> Allows collection of rocks from contract fields during cultivating, and sowing contracts with a stone picker.
>             
> NOTES:
> - Although rocks can be collected during a cultivating contract, they may show back up when the contract is completed.
> - The only time rocks can / will be removed from a map is if they are collected before sowing during a sowing contract.
